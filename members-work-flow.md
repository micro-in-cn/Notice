### Develop Repo Sets: [Micro-Community](https://github.com/micro-community),we use this like a development branch, we wish it more active and all members drive it..

## Very Simple Flow

1、Fork Repo : Anyone Fork a repo from [Micro-In-China](https://github.com/micro-in-cn) to [Micro-Community](https://github.com/micro-community)

2、Work with members in the single Forked Repo ,which will encourage your passion.
